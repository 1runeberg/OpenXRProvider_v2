# OpenXR Provider Library v2
# Sample 06 - Finger Painting

Demonstrates use of multi-vendor extensions (Handtracking) and single vendor (Meta/FB Passthrough).

Designed for the Quest Pro on standalone mode - this shows how to unlock the potential of new devices with OpenXR. 
However, also demonstrates how your app's device support can be made too narrow.

In the next demo app, we'll build this sample further and introduce the OpenXR Input system. We'll backup interaction
paths with the input system to expand our list of supported devices.
