# OpenXR Provider Library v2
# Sample 05 - Hello PBR

Demo application with a more advanced rendering pipeline. This also introduced xrvk - which will be further built as an optional companion Vulkan renderer for the OpenXR Provider Library

PC VR users note that the renderer doesn't render/blit to a desktop mirror. You'll need to use the OpenXR runtime's built-in mirror.
